# ScalaCon 2021 Live Demos
The starter code from my ScalaCon talk on ScalaPy.

There are two demos we implmented live:
- `src/main/scala/deeplearning` - training a GPT-2 model to code complete Scala code with ScalaPy
- `src/main/scala/modeling` - modeling the knapsack problem with mixed-integer programming

Each of these folders has a backup Scala file which contains the solution. If you want to try implementing the code yourself, you can use the other Scala file.
